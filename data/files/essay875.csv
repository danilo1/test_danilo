"1999_787983.txt","College is awesome. There are so many good-looking girls. The atmosphere is free and open. I wish we didn't have class so I could go out and party every night. Partying has been fun. I get drunk, but I know my limit. I go where ever the party. Free beer is always good. I don't understand why the Asians frats have a cover charge to get in. There is not a lot of alcohol, and the parties suck. Although I'm Asian, I can't stand them. Asian guys dress weirdly, and the girls look funny. I associate myself with the whites. I grew up in a white neighborhood. I didn't have a white friend until I moved to Texas which was 5 years. I only have a handful of Asian friends. Whites are a lot more fun to hang out with. They're more open and do whatever. I prefer my girlfriend to be white. In the past, I had 3 white girlfriends and 1 Asian girlfriend. Right now, I would like a white one, but I'm going after an Asian one. She is not like the others. She doesn't really like Asians either. She is half Japanese and half Vietnamese. I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese. She also happens to be in the same pyschology class. She sits next to me most of the times. I always sit next to my best friend, Zach. He is cool. He knows when to party. I have a lot of friends in there, and most of them are from Taylor High School. There so many Taylor students in there and at UT. That reminds me, the girl who sat next to me today would not quit laughing. At first, I thought she was cool. Things changed as the lecture progressed. The girl who sat in the row behind me, 5 seats to the right wearing the red Hilfiger shirt was good looking. I wish I was white so I could approach white girls with better ease. Man oh man. There so many pretty girls in that class. Microeconomics has a lot too. Especially the one two rows down from me. I normally sleep in that class, but she kept me awake. Damn. I wish I approached her. Kinsolving is an excellent place to eat. A lot of girls eat there. My parents are bringing up my bike on Saturday, and I'm excited. I definitely need a bike. They'll probably take me shopping and out to lunch. I probably take my roommate and woman along. My roommmate is pretty cool. Could be an asshole at times, but who isn't?  We went to school together. We have three classes together including pysch. Right now, I'm pissed at Edwin. He is one of my friends and is also in the pysch class. He won't shut up. He is starting to get annoying. He says a lot of stupid things. He doesn't like UT or something. When he is wrong, he will try to do some bullshit that makes him look right. Such an idiot. My Eco teacher is so stupid. Such an FOB. I just sleep in it now. Computer Science is so hard. I might drop it. That's it for now. ","y","n","n","n","y"
