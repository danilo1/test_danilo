"2003_452.txt","What an odd assignment, write about anything for 20 minutes straight. I really like UT but it is so huge, sometimes I wished I had stayed in College Station. My boyfriend and friends are still in College Station, I was so close to Houston and that is were my family resides. Its only a hour and a half drive but from Austin its an extra 30 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving. My brother is nearby in San Marcos and that is only spitting distance from here. While living at home this past summer I didn't like it that much, now I really miss those crazy people I call my family. There was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love. I really need to start working out again because living in Austin is making me chubby. You would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking. I have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, I can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow. Its our 6 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one. I have known him for about 2 years now and its definitely better to be friends first. My family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways. He is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money. Money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it. Everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages. What is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in American history. So many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly. Its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth. Its hard to imagine what I would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way. Its hard to think about without getting emotional. I would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, I would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy. Its pouring down rain right now, and I hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside. I'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, I definitely feel I'm paying my dues though and hopefully I can do something positive with this college education.
