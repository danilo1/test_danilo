"2000_895005.txt","I don't feel like going to class today, but because I paid a great amount of money for this education I might as well. But wait, it's a discussion class for Calculus, oh well, it's not like I understood anything what Dr. Friedman was saying yesterday in class. Do I really have to walk all the way over there? If I don't go, I can spend some of that time studying for a chemistry test tomorrow, as well as download some more songs off the Internet. The chemistry test is my first test and I don't how Dr. Brodbelt makes her tests. But because it's over the first two chapters, which were basically a review of chemistry in High School, hopefully, it might be easy. I sure hope so! Ahhh. school, it's getting on my nerves. Let this week calm down, it'll be okay next week. I can't wait until the weekend. On my gosh, I have 30 minutes until my next class, what should I do? Sleep, nahh. what if I oversleep, that would be bad. I guess I should start packing my books and looking for my keys to lock the room, which by the way, I really don't understand why the lock on the door opens when you turn the key to the left, and locks when you turn the key to the right. Shouldn't it be the other way around? Oh well, why am I making such a big deal about it, it provides me the security of my place. I should be thankful. Anyhow, I need to get to class.
