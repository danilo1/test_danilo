"2000_071231.txt","Here I am in college. It's pretty weird and scary all at the same time. Justin is in Kansas, he says that he is in love with me now that he is away from me. I on the other hand have pulled away. He was so controlling and bad to me in high school that it is hard for me to turn away now that he is so nice and perfect. I love him very much, but I've met another guy who is so perfect in everyway. He is so nice and understanding, some much more than I've ever experienced. Mom is coming today. Yesterday was my birthday so she is coming today to take me to eat and bring me some presents. I am so tired, I was up until 6 this morning, she is going to think I'm sick. I don't know how I made it to my morning classes. On Fridays I am done by 11 am! That is so nice. I kind of miss my friends back home. It's hard to having friends that don't understand you completely yet. I love texas! ","y","n","y","n","y"
