"2000_094896.txt","I haven't had a very good afternoon. I've been trying to get my Ethernet hookup to work for 2 days, without success. I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to computers, so I had my friend come and hook it up for me. But to my unpleasant surprise, we couldn't get it to work! Today, all afternoon, I tried and tried to figure it out. I screamed, cried, and almost threw my computer out of the window. Then, just when I was about to give up, I figured it out! But, with my neverending good luck, I found out that the entire Internet server was down for all of my apartment complex. So, I had to drive all the way to west campus (I live on East Riverside) to use my friend's computer tonight. In other words, I'm in a pretty pissed off mood. Anyway, I'm drinking one of those Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails to calm myself down. I hope it works. Man, my back hurts. About 2 months ago, I fell off of a roof while sunbathing (topless, of course) and besides knocking myself unconscious, and embarrassing the hell out of myself, I fractured 2 vertebrae in my back. It was probably the most intelligent thing I've ever done. So, now that I'm slowly weaning myself off of the Vicadin the doctor proscribed, I seem to be in more pain than ever. It doesn't help that I have to carry a back pack around campus everyday, either. But, what can I do? The fractures weren't big enough to require surgery, so all I can do is wait until I heal. But, according to my wonderful doctor, I wasn't supposed to be feeling any pain by now. Wrong! I think I'm going to have to go back and get some more Xrays. Something isn't quite right. So my friend Laura is getting ready for sixth street and I'm stuck here doing crappy homework. This assignment isn't so bad, but I have French homework to do after this and that's what's going to suck. I love French, but my teacher this semester bites the big one. She makes going to class a real drag for me. That's never happened before, so I'm pretty ticked off about it. Gee, I hope my Art History Professor from last semester writes me back soon. He was supposed to change my grade from a C to a B because of some mistake in grading, and I recently checked my grade report only to find out that the grade was never changed. I want to know what the hell happened. Well, my twenty minutes are up. I'm a pretty slow typist, so I hope this is enough. ","n","y","n","n","y"
