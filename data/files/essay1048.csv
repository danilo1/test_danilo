"2000_073377.txt","Hmmm. don't know what to write. Maybe Erin will call back soon. Glad Leah is not coming home tonight, place all to myself. Fabulous. Wonder where Melissa is and if she wants to do something tonight. I do, but I am tired and I have stuff to do, but bored with stuff. The room is dark and lonely, but good that Leah isn't here. Hopefully Erin will call soon. Haven't been able to have a good conversation with her since she went to California. Miss her a lot, wish she were in Leah's place. But, she'll be here in four days for Dave. Dave is coming up soon, I can't wait. Wish Melissa would go with us, so it'll be less like couples, but Preston and Carlo will be there, we'll have to see them. They are Justin's friends and he probably wants to see them too, probably not as much as he wants to see Erin, but its cool, it would be cool to hang out with those two guys. That way I could get Preston's number and I could network with what he's doing. It's all about the networking. Dave is going to be so much fun, I can't wait, but it would be better if Leah and Mike weren't going. But what could you do? Hopefully Justin will take his car and us true Dave fans can get there early and not wait for the non Dave fans. I'm so tired. Definitely bored too. Those neighbors are so random, they are always making noise, but they are such dorks. They better contain themselves or we will have a definite problem. And what is Kelly's deal? She has totally distanced herself. Is it because she thinks Melissa and my friendship has become too much or does she just not like me or is it because her friend was in town? I definitely feel neglected. I mean I try to be cool and nice to her. I try to be nice to everyone, I'm nonconfrontational, that's probably why people like me. I don't know. I wish Leah didn't take that stupid poster that I wanted. Every time I look at it, it pisses me off. God. She is definitely annoying, I swear what a poser of everything, hey maybe you could get an identity of your own and stop stealing everyone else's. Fabulous. Dave is so awesome, I can't wait. Could I love you, could you love me? I definitely need a guy, I am so sick of all these couples, it's so annoying. I mean I deserve a guy, right? It has been a while. I'm just too damn picky, but I am about everything. It's good right? Quality over quantity? I hope so. But, more people are more fun and you can always find something to do. I need to find or run into those two girls from the other night, they seemed cool, maybe people I could get along with. Mainly that Izzy girl, the other reminded me of Jakki Barsalou and she had some tongue thing, which both could be bad. That stupid bear. God! Oh my neck hurts, it's so stiff. I definitely need a good massage. Another thing boyfriends are good for. Good seeing mom today, definitely miss all that. But, I'm being strong. Definitely almost started crying about all of Kim's problems today. Which is weird, because I hardly know her anymore, but I guess we have some sort of childhood bond. Maybe, it is because I feel like I can sort of relate. It was weird, maybe I just need to cry or something, get it out of the system. ","y","y","n","n","y"
