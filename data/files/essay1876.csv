"2002_953576.txt","     This is a bad ass song. i wish Patrick were here so we could drink some beer and hang out. it is too bad he is in a gay ass fraternity. i can't stand his freaking brothers. at least Robbie isn't in a gay fraternity, we chill more than me and Pat ever will. i wish i weren't so fucking sick, i hate the fact that i have to blow my nose every 10 to 15 minutes. and no my freaking printer is going nuts, i hope it isn't broken, it is brand new. it looked like the actual scanner piece is jammed or something. that girl i met today in Economics was pretty cute, i think she was feeling me. i wish i hadn't broke that string on my guitar i miss her badly. i haven't played in almost 2 days. i don't know if i can go another day with out playing it. i am so glad tommorow is Friday, i need a beer. i just wish i didn't feel so bad, all i want to do is sleep. i sure hope this works tonight i didn't work lastnight. i want to be a rock star!  that would the best job ever!  just playing my guitar and singing my songs!  i want to have a good time tommorow night just chill with some friends a drink some beer!  i need a beer, i am defenately going to grab a cold one when this is over. so close.
