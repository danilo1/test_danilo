"2000_940609.txt","I swear that office space is the funniest movie I have ever seen. ''Yeah, hi!''. ''It's Bill Lumb. ''. I can't stop laughing. Albert is on the bed hugging a leopard pillow. Jo just emailed me from St. Louis and I don't know if she's okay. I haven't talked to her since I left for school. She is okay to take care of herself I guess. I can't believe that Pami, Liz and Katy left for Dave without me. They suck, oh well. I'm doing fine myself so I guess it doesn't really matter, shit, I've got the place to myself. College life is pretty bad ass. No one really cares what I do, well I guess my parents care. Oh well, I guess I'm in another state and it really doesn't matter. Liz is so retarded that she bought a poster about the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's. She picked that out of all the Bob Marley and Pink Floyd posters there. I guess that is just her style. ''I'm going to have to ask you to move again to another office'' ''That would be great'' But I set the building on fire. It is so funny I can't even stop laughing. I wonder if Kenny is going to call tonight. I really do wonder how much longer I will really be with him. I love him to death but I'm to young to have a serious boyfriend. Al is so funny. He looks like he would be all buff and mean but he is really complete goof. He tries to get all big so he can impress the ''ho's'' but he doesn't understand that he can't do that. He's to goofy. Just kidding. He kicks ass though so I guess its all good. I can't believe my dad made me add another class. Schools already been going for about two weeks and Ill have to make up the work. Plus all the other stuff I have to do. I want to be able to go out more, and have fun. That's what college is for. I'm still going to study a hell of a lot but also party too. I don't want to miss out on anything and then have to feel regret for not doing all that I'm allowed to do now that I'm in college. I don't understand why everyone is freaking out. I guess their just freshman, well so am I but oh well, and they will get in the hang of it soon enough. Peace out PSYCHOLOGY its been twenty minutes. ","y","n","y","y","y"
