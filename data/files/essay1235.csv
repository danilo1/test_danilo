"2000_676072.txt","Okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to Dallas last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend Zach who is now in Colorado trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for TXOU and the Santana concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister Maggie is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a Catholic church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the University of Dallas which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in Dobie, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in Dallas. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister Jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when Kim is getting home. I think she said 5:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with Reese. Reese is probably lonely without Jessica around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. Kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 17 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on Amy's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! ","y","y","n","y","y"
