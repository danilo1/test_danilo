"2003_26.txt","Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the University, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From Laurel's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 20 real'' seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. So for every ''real'' minute, 75 seconds go by. So in a 20 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 25 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 12:01 when I started, and now it is     12:37 and I still have 2 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my ''2'' minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. ","n","n","y","y","y"
