"1999_652329.txt","WEll right now I'm doubting I can write for the next 20 minutes straight. I don't think I have that much material, that's worth putting down anyway. Id rather be doing something else for the next 18 minutes. I'm looking forward to going out tonight. There is a party and it should be a lot of fun. I'm going to get drunk and that will be fun. Class this week was interesting, however I worry that I am falling behind in a couple of my classes. There's so much reading and such little time. I'm pledging Delt and that keeps me really busy. That's who the party is with tonight, my pledge class. They are pretty cool guys. These guys keep walking in here and interupting my writing. That is annoying. I had this girlfriend named Erin. We broke up before we came to school. I think about her a lot now. I guess I miss her. I hope she is doing well. i am still thinking about her. I need to go help a couple of my friends sneak liquor up into Towers. My time is just about up anyway. This really wasn't that bad of an assignment. I had fun. See you in class.
