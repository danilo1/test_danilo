"1999_572969.txt","As I sat here reading the assignment, half of me read the words while the other half of me sat concentrating on my sweaty palms that I only seconds ago was rubbing. My stomach is apparently telling me that I am hungry in its own noisy language. I just went to a 50th anniversary party for my grandparents last night. I got up to speak with the other grandkids. My cousin Jaffray, who lost her mother (my aunt) about 10 years ago spoke before me about how incredibly remarkable they have been acting as her parental role models, support system, and financial suppliers. By the time the michrophone ( I do not know how to spell ''mike'' [I guess]) got to me. . well- I didn't get to speak. I woke up this morning thinking about what I wanted to say, and I decided that whenI finish this assignment, I will write them a note to write them what my tears prevented me from saying. That reminds me of another letter I need to write- a totally belated graduation present thank you letter. I don't feel like a complete jerk- I received the gift pretty late. I just took notice of my blistered feet. They took some serious heat from rush. My sister and I are now in the same sorority. Hopefully, that can be a tie that binds. We get along so well- when we're apart. It's kind of a shame that we lived together for so long (sometimes sharing a room) because we probably could have been the best of friends.
