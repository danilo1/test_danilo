"2003_25.txt","My side really hurts. I wonder if I have appendicitis or something. I wonder if I pulled something this morning in that dance class. That guy was so hot. And such an amazing dancer!  I wish I could move like him. The way he was able to separate his joints and dance so flowing was so cool. I can't wait to see their performance this Friday. I also can't wait to see The Starting Line. Yay! I am going to fall in love with Kenny and he is going to fall in love with me. Oh crap, I need to find that confirmation number. I have a lot of work to do over these next few days. I hope tonight is fun, and worth the gas to get there. Whitney seems to be a real bitch sometimes, I still hope I get to room with her. I wonder if this Jessica girl is a lesbian. She sure is not the girl I thought she was, but I think I'll have fun with her in Tuscon. The Arizona Dance thing sounds like so much fun. It seems like everything is just falling into place. I'm not really nervous about the audition for UA, but I probably will be later on. God, what is this pain in my side?  I wonder if I should see a doctor, or wait, I already am. I am so sick of commuting to school. Living on campus is going to be so nice. I need to send in my application soon. Its cool that I saw Adam today, and Michael yesterday. I still like Michael, damnit!  I wonder if I'll ever get over him. Oh but I'm marrying Kenny so Ill just have to. I really need to start eating more healthy. If I want to have a long career as a dancer, I should be taking better care of my body. But I'm not in that bad of shape. I'm probably overreacting. The thunder outside reminds me of the time I was in this room, and there was a tornado outside. I miss those times of being young, I really miss Hawaii. I love Austin though. Now that I'm going to UT, I'm starting to realize how lucky I am to be going to school in such a cool place. I really hope I get into UA, or OCU, but I really hope UA. I know whatever happens, happens for a reason. I think going to UT this year was the perfect thing for me. I love it, and all the nice people I have met in dance, I feel right at home. I wonder if I'll want to leave. I shouldn't have eaten that nasty egg roll today, its probably what's making me feel sick. I hope I didn't offend Jessica in anyway. No, I'm just overreacting. I really miss Micheline. I wonder where she is, if she moved, why she hasn't returned my calls. She is so pretty, I wish I looked like her. I wonder what Patrick is up to these days, I want to hear the songs he wrote about me, but it would be hard to call him after all this time. I'm not going to be another guys girlfriend unless I actually, truly like him. Goddamn, didn't Ben teach me that lesson?  I hate Ben. No I shouldn't say that, I loathe him. He disgusts me. Should I spend the night at Rachel's tonight?  I can read Chapter 22 tomorrow at 11, and then I'll go buy the tickets. I think I could afford to sleepover at her place then tonight. God, this pain won't go away!  What is it?  Should I cut these bracelets off, they're starting to look a little scraggly. I can't wait to go swimming in that pool Saturday morning, that's the day of the concert!  I am going to give my number to Kenny, no chickening out!  He and I are meant to be, I just have to keep believing that. I kind of feel nauseous, its that pain in my side. ","n","n","y","n","y"
