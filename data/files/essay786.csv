Horriblr thing to happen. I hope Matt stays in school. I worry about everyone too much Not enough about me. I'm glad I can be the strong one and be there for them. i wish we were all back at home. Right now home feels so far I would love to hug my mom. she is worried about me. her baby away at school. what am I doing at this school. i feel so lost. Is this where I meant to be  Ineed a reason to be here. I'm not supposed to be lonely. Will I ever fall in love I hate being in this room alone. I need someone here with me. why is life so confusing? What do my feelings mean everyone has it so together. Will I? I put too much meaning in everything. Poor Max What a wasted life. He needed someone to help him. I want to be there for matt but he needs time to grieve. I can't be intrusive. I need to stop trying to fix everthing. Its all planned out already. I hope I see Brian tomorrow. He gives me something to look forward to. Hes such a nice guy. Is he interested in me? Tomorrow is a new day. Today has opened my eyes. Don't take life for granted. ","n","y","y","n","n"
