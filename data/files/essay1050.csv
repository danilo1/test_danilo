"2000_075257.txt","I'm so excited that my computer is doing what it is supposed to be doing today. Its really cool that I can watch movies through this sucker. Are you just supposed to write about whatever? This is pretty cool. I wanted to roller blade and some piece of crap girl told me I couldn't because some cop told her she'd get a $50 ticket, and plus it was raining, so that sucks. I am so ready to go out. I'm getting tired of sitting in my room all the time. I wonder what Jason thinks about me. Does he still want to get back together with his exgirlfriend that sucks. If he does then he's stupid because I'm probably way cooler than her, and she's only a junior in high school. That's ridiculous. Boy's are so stupid sometimes. I can't believe the things they do. I want to play hockey. I miss playing hockey with my neighbors. Maybe I'll find somewhere to roller blade, and I'll be able to play hockey. That'd be good. Shannon wanted me to teach her how to play anyway so that would work out well since she's an RA. She'd probably know of a place around here that is good to skate on. Man, I wish my hair would grow out. It looks so dumb since its too short to get into a good pony tail and I don't feel like fixing it most of the time. I want to get purple streaks put in it. That would be pretty interesting. What if I got my eyebrow or my lip pierced? I bet that'd be weird. Just to look at yourself in the mirror with that would be different, plus my mom wouldn't freak out or anything. I hope radio shack gets that 6foot cord in soon, so I can get this TV thing working better and get some of these stupid cords out of my way. I'm glad Jason traded cable connectors with me, so I could move the TV across the room. He wasn't using the length of it anyway. I really wish my mom hadn't sold my Nintendo, Mario 3 sure would be fun right about now. I wish I was funnier. I can't ever say anything funny. I only laugh at other people or at myself when I do something stupid or klutzy. That was so funny when Bobby ran into that pole. I still can't get over that. He's a weird guy, but he sure is cute. At least Chris is finally being half nice to me. That's different. I still can't believe he sat by me in sociology today. That's so weird. Matt is my friend and he never sits by me. Butt hole. I need to read for that class. I'm glad I only have one 1 o'clock class on Fridays, so I can sleep late. I hate getting up early. It sucks bad. Ultimate Frisbee would be so fun on Saturday. Nicole is lucky to get to be in rowing. I want to join something. I halfway miss track, but not quite. It really sucks with Coach McCoy yelling at you all the time. I don't know what the crap this thing is. Stupid cat. Radio Shack always tries to rip you off. That was weird when I got in that fight with the lady at the hotel in Cancun. She was so bitchy. I can't believe she thought we would steal the nasty bedspread from their skanky hotel. I want Lindsey and Jason to come visit me. I miss them. Dorks still in high school. Oh, well. I hope Lindsey is liking cheerleading more than she did her freshman year. I don't want her to go to Baylor next year. She needs to come her. That would be cool, but then I wouldn't be able to have any fun because I'd be afraid that she would get mad at me. I know I shouldn't care what Jason thinks since we only met like three weeks ago, but that boy is driving me crazy. He's so hard to read. I need to get in touch with Rachel and see what is up with her new baby brother or sister and find out what Taylor's address in Iowa is. For someone who liked me so much, he should have told me when he was leaving or something. What a spaz monkey! I wish I could get in touch with Tony. Eww. I need to call Preston. He's a weirdo. I need to see what concerts are coming up. He always knows all that crazy crap. That guy matt is pretty cool. I should email him or something. I need to go visit Roy. He's in a fraternity. Frats are so weird. They only seem to talk about their brothers and crap. Nicole is getting on my nerves somewhat. I know I shouldn't let the little stuff bother me, but when I'm with her all the time, its insane. Why can't she breathe with her mouth shut when she's sleeping. She needs to blow her nose or something. Anyway. This is a good song. I want to hear that Incubus song. That's awesome. ","y","n","n","y","y"
