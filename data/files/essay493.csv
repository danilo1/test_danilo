"1998_695943.txt","For instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd of students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. In addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because I live off campus. I attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems I haven't established any new friendships yet. However,  I will continue my efforts throughout the semester. Furthermore, I have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework I have been assigned each evening. It is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. I have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles I encounter. I have dreamed of earning my degree at the University of Texas since I was a small child. As I grew into a young adult, I never let go of my aspiration to attend the University. My unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. I will accomplish my goals and I will prove to myself and family I can do anything that I put my mind to. When I get discouraged, I refer to the scripture, ''I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. ''  I know I can succeed at the University of Texas with my sincere desire and strong determination. ","y","n","y","y","n"
