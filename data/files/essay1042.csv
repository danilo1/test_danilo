"2000_056817.txt","I miss my guitar. I wish that I had brought one of them with me. I have to be sure to bring my amp and at least one guitar, maybe two of them back from home this weekend. That kind of sucks though, that I let mom borrow the one I really want to bring with me. I am glad though that she taking lessons. Maybe I could teach her some Metallica. I hope she helps Erin pay for that car she wants. But Erin also wants to get it repainted, because she just doesn't like the color. Oh well, I'm glad Erin is getting that car, BMW's are real safe. I should know, I've totaled enough of them. That scares me though, because kids have wrecks, and I've already lost a cousin, I don't know what I would do if I lost my sister. At least they're safe cars. I hope I can get a car for Christmas. I know I totaled a bunch of cars, but I was also an addict when I was in all of those wrecks, and I'm better now, it could be a reward. My doctor is really proud of me. When I told him that I had been clean for 101 days, he was very proud and said that ''a lot of times adults can't even do that, so you must be an adult. '' I was happy about that. I just wish that my dad was as proud, and understanding of how hard this is, and what a real accomplishment this is. ","n","y","n","n","y"
