"1998_914538.txt","You all are going to read this and say, Who the heck is this freak? The first day of the semester. I¹m tired already. I want to change to world half the time and it¹s not at all working. I hate people sometimes and I like them the next. How can people lie to you, straight to your face and still not have any trouble what so ever sleeping. Have we no morals at all? All I can think of as I return once again to the glorious UT campus is how everyone is just paying to party; paying to drink, dance and meet people. I want to learn, but I want to have fun too. I can¹t believe that all anyone thinks about anymore is the same old same old; drugs-alcohol, sex and rock and roll okay so maybe it¹s more R&B now a days. I must be warped. I want someone to tell me yeah it was a great weekend because I got to go here or there and I met with my friend so and so. Not Hey it was a great weekend, I got some chick to come back to my dorm and I got plastered. What is that? Am I the only one who thinks this way? I can¹t be. It just can¹t be that rare that I would be the only one who would want to do something besides drink and party 24/7. I must be jaded. Yes, I¹m a junior. Yes I¹ve been here a lot longer than half of these kids, fish, in our PSY class. But still, the campus is still a new place to me. Everyday is something new. I learn something new. I meet a new person. Something, anything. But something tangible. I¹m not talking about some whim like bouncing from party to party. Being pseudo friends and all. I try to be genuine. I don¹t lie to people. I¹m friendly damn it. I used to like people. People made me this way. All the mean rotten people in this world who want to lie to my face, cheat me out of my rights or just blatantly go out of their way to be rude and downright spiteful. How rude is that? I can¹t believe what our society has come to be. I can¹t wait to start learning how some people think. What makes our brain tick. Why am I the way I am. Why  that mean lady who cut me off right on my way home is the way she is, like she didn¹t see my blinker, that¹s what that stupid little light is for. I didn¹t pay extra to just have extra decorations on my car. As if. Then she honks at me, like I was in the wrong, she knows she was speeding up to close the gap. How rude! I want to know why they think this way. Is this like the beginning of all of this Armageddon story. Is that what the 21st century is bringing our way. Why are we all fighting. And why am I so cynical when I¹m only 19. I should still be a naive little student who loves the world and everyone in it. But still. There are such things as being right and being wrong. What ever happen to a person¹s word? I want to know. There has to be others like me who think this way. I¹m not the only one who thinks we¹re wasting our time here. There are more important things to do in our world than worry about which frat is having the next party and whose dating who and all of that petty stupid little gossip things that buzz around the world everyday. You know it happens. It starts every morning at the water cooler or something like that and people just begin their little digs for the day. What is it with us. I hope humans weren¹t always this stupid, because let me tell you we¹re at a downfall here; crime, attitudes, lying, no morals, all of that. You know what I¹m talking about, don¹t you computer? I¹m babbling. I just want everything to make sense. It doesn¹t now. I don¹t know. I want the world to change, but how can it, when will it, what are we going to do. . . ","n","y","n","y","n"
