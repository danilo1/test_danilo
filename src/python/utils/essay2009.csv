"2003_162.txt","Right now it is 11:25. I am sitting by myself in the dorm at Hardin House. It is raining very hard outside. Earlier I went to Target and bought a Brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so I got home and then had to drive all the way back. I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. I love UT however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when I go out at night. I went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged Theta. I am having so much fun and I love all of the girls in my sorority. My friends and I have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. When I walk in the room I don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. Also since living in Austin I have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. I have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. I have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example Hula Hut, Shady Grove, Dirty's and much more. As I walk down the drag I notice that there is a large variety of people in Austin. Yesterday I had my first encounter with the infamous Leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street. Apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. Also today when I went to Einstein bagels I looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. College in Austin is much different than my small private high school in Tulsa. I never knew how sheltered we all were and I am so glad that I have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real'' world. Right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. It is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. I live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. Although there are many distractions at Hardin House, I am so glad this is where I live. I have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. Everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50,000 plus people. Sometimes it is, like when I walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. But then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. I have already found a group of people I ''hang out'' with everyday and I almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. I am so excited for the Arkansas game this weekend. Football is my favorite sport and I really hope the Longhorns can beat OU this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. On Tuesday I joined a group call TAG, Texas Advertising Group, because I am trying to transfer in to the Communications College. I am a little nervous about that because I heard it was very difficult. I am currently in the Liberal Arts school as an English major. My classes seem to be going very well. I think after this paper I am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the Sex and the City DVD with my friends because they are all avid watchers while I have never seen a single episode. I never really get hooked on a TV series. I always just watch the show when it comes out on video. ","y","n","y","n","y"
