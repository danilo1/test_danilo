"2004_390.txt","Well, I'm not exactly sure what to write about. I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 1. 5 credits for it. So I only have to get 3. 5 more I guess to get the 5. I hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long. I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on. I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. I don't know how I'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes. I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. I have so much homework to do this weekend. I guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. I guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. I have to go to Dallas to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, I really don't want to go though. We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to. Oh, I met these friends at UT. They are so great. One of them really. Her name is Sarah and she's really nice. I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year. She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm. I don't know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard. Carol is talking about Sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. She thinks Sarah is so cool. I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I'm just eating a normal amount of food. I try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn't always great. Oh, Kinsolving isn't all that great. Some of the food is good, but I can't stand eating there every day. They need to have food on this campus other than chicken. I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I've been here I've been dying for beef. The other day I was so stupid. I was talking to Carol on the phone and I said, ''I'm tired, but I don't want to lay down. I'm bored but I don't want to do anything. I'm not hungry, but I'm dying for meat. ''  I bet I sounded so stupid. I drove home today from Austin. I really didn't want to becuase I haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again. I can't wait till I get to go to Casa Ole again. I can't believe Austin doesn't have them here. That is like the stupidest thing in the world. I take that back. The stupidest thing in the world is that UT doesn't sell Dr. Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr. Pepper the best. My mom just woke up. I finally found one places on campus that has it though. The Union has Dr. Pepper at the Taco Bell. I haven't checked anywhere else yet. My dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today. I can't believe that happened. They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. My dogs are fighting. I have two dogs, Milo and Brewser. Milo is a red beagle that is Brewser's son and he turned a year old May 15, 2004. Brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on October 11, 2004. It's weird to think of their age. Milo is really crazy and Brewser is really calm. It probably is because he is so old though. I felt so stupid today in Biology. We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn't have it completely right. The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in ''If, Then'' form. Meaning that this would be an example, ''IF we put this together, THEN this should happen. ''  In this class though, its just a statement. No ifs. No thens. No questions. It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group. There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it. All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in Austin here at UT. Out of my high school we had 106 seniors. Out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY. Out of those 59, 35 went to aTm. I can't get over that. Only 2 of us came to UT and that is me and my ex boyfriend, Nathan. I am afraid of what all my aTm ''friends'' would say if I couldn't make it here. I really don't know what to talk about. I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can't think of what to say. My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms. My mom is out feeding Milo and Brewser. Oh, Milo is actually mine. I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's. Carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple. The dog's name is Bart. Carol is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. I have to say, that since I've been writing it, I have to agree. I think it's kind of cool, but I really don't see the point in having to write this all out. Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. Oh, well. I'm getting credit for it. Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. I'm going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing. Sarah and Gabby were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets. Gabby got one but while Sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her.
