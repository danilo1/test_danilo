"1997_821162.txt","Ok twenty minutes. what am I going to do tomorrow night?  What am I going to do tonight I've got lots of work to do. Man, there's lots to do and little time to do it in. I can't  wait, till I finish this. only. too much time left. What else, to write about. I have no stream of consciousness. ok, it's great to be next door to the RA, there's always a party next door, it  makes it easier to study that way. what else, what else. I’ve got lots to do  tonight. what else. Austin, cool place. my roommate’s studying, that’s what I've got to do. I wish I had a TV. it gets so boring at night. I’ve got to call my girlfriend, man I miss her. . boy I’m tired. this doesn't look like a lot of writing for. . 6 minutes. only six minutes. that means there's fourteen minutes left. I've got a real impressive stream of consciousness, and I’m a good speller too  Fish think better than I do. what else. uh. I've got to go to the store buy  some food. go work out tomorrow. am I almost done yet. nooo. lots more time left  A guy in a coma, probably has a better stream of consciousness. what do I need to do tomorrow. I think I’m going to apply for a credit card. why not?  man I’m hungry. ten minutes left. halfway through. psychology. I hope this class will be interesting. it's a lot different than I thought it would be, all we do is fill out surveys about stuff. Oh well,, I’m not looking forward to doing these experiment/research requirements. But it's gotta be better than writing a paper  I guess he paper is used as an alternative, because they know nobody will want to write a paper. and they want everybody to participate in the experiments seven minutes left  UT, UT, there's a game on Saturday, I’m gonna have to get my tickets tomorrow before  they're all out. I don't want to sit all the way up at the top. my first game, can't wait, gonna be cool. I’m glad I didn't go to Aggieland five minutes and counting. What else. chemistry. I’ve got too much to do English. she assigned over one hundred pages of reading in two days. Chemistry. calculus. way too much too think about. college is gonna be more difficult than highschool, I can already tell this. three minutes. not bad. Wow I just got e mail I wonder who it is,,, I’d like to know, but I've got two minutes left. It doesn't seem like its been twenty minutes. but oh two minutes left. I’m sure this is not what they wanted. but that’s me twenty four hours a day  pretty sad. oh well. come on come on one minute. yes  well this has been fun, at least I've gotten it finished. alright.
