"2000_476720.txt","I am writing an assignment for psychology. Stream of consciousness. What am I thinking right now? What am I thinking for the next twenty minutes? Chris is watching the television. Wresting. WWF. Idiots in spandex. T. V. is slowly killing us off. The announcer's scream. Loud, emotional, fake. Why do people watch it? Reality is more fun when it's fake. Big brother. Survivor. The real world. I hate the real world. True strangers, picked to live in a house, and devour each other alive. Devour. I want some ice cream, but I'm not hungry. They had Mexican food for supper tonight. There was a band playing. A Mexican band. I didn't like it. Music. Radiohead's new cd comes out October 3. Hell yeah! Kid A is the name of it. If I could be in any band it would be Radiohead. The television is distracting me. Wrestlers coming to the ring from the future. Futuristic wrestlers, live on television. And some people still believe it. Chris just changed the channel. MTV now. Carson Daly, and his Total Request Live. I'm ashamed of my generation. I feel sorry for Britney Spears, N'Sync, and all the other pop groups that greedy business men package to be sold. In five years where will they be? The kids who love them now will laugh at them, and call them queers, has beens. Telephone is ringing. Chris answered it. It's for him. He rarely gets a phone call. I get all the calls. The end of my twenty minutes is coming up. Fifteen seconds, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ","n","n","y","n","y"
