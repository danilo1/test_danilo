"2002_655082.txt","Well, well, what to write about?  I'm sure this topic comes up often in a stream of conciousness writing assignment. I really wanted to complete this assignment a few days ago. I had an interesting dream that I think probably had some significant psychological value. I'm not sure if I can remember much of it, but I'll try to recall. Nope, sorry. Ha ha. Let's see, it said to write about your current observations. Here's what's happening: music is playing, room mate's music is also playing. I guess I should try to find a song that might be relevant to our next discussion topic in class, but I'm not sure what that is right now. It really makes me mad that I actually tried to go do a load of laundry and all the machines are full. I can't believe that the entire dorm of Prather is supposed to share only four washing machines. That really sucks. I hate doing laundry as it is, but I refuse to wait in line. So, I decided to come do this assignment and figured the line would be gone. This is a good song, 311 - Amber. This is a slooowww twenty minutes. Last night was pretty boring, I didn't know of a whole lot going on. I should have called that Mila chick or that Meggie girl. They're pretty hot. Wonder if they're interested in me?  I just met them, guess I shouldn't really wonder about that yet. They're cool to hang out with, except Meggie's friend Michelle is a BITCH. I can't believe I took them out and they left with some of their friends. Ah, Counting Crows, Mr. Jones- good tune!  I think I'll call Mary Beth later and see what's up with Mila. I wish I would have eaten lunch before I started this. pretty hungry. Wow, a whole 13 and a half min. left to go. Ha, Will just walked in here to see if I thought his hair was cool. Jack and him are crazy guys. I wonder what I should go get for lunch today?  I guess I'll ask Ian what he feels like. I wonder if there's a length requirement on this assignment?  Probably not. I bet some people will be half-ass'n though. I need to figure out what other homework I need to do this weekend. I know I have some math to work on if I have time, but I really need to read that Philosophy first. The last book, Plato's Phaedo, was somewhat interesting, but was disheartening to learn that he was wrong at the discussion section on Friday. I just need to look at my PDA, I put all my assignments in there on Friday, I think. Man, I hope I can get some tickets to the UT and A and M game. Or the UT OU game. I don't understand the concepts of the draw exactly. The little draw sheet says I need to check out a website to get a wristband for the draw. I wonder what's going on back in Corsicana?  Probably not a whole lot. I guess I should call Mom here after I get done. I forgot to call her yesterday. What else do I need to do today?  I'll feel better after I get done with this, it's been kind of hanging over my head since it's been assigned. I really feel sorry for whoever might read this, it's probably incredibly boring. I wonder what anyone can tell about me by stream of conciousness. Let's see, Ian just walked by and wanted me to type   Zestfully Clean.   Guess we'll go eat in about 5 minutes. He thinks I should just be typing randomly instead of in sentences. Oooh, only four more minutes. I wonder how long this will be. I think those chairs we bought at Academy for the room yesterday are going to work out pretty well. I really like the table too. I just hope that after we buy the carpet that the room can be rearranged into a more efficient arrangment. That would be cool if this thing had spell checker on it. I'm impressed by the HTML timer though. I should learn something about HTML programming. I think some class I had said we would, can't remember which one that was. Wouldn't that be cool to get to a length limit?  Let's see, back to things to do today. Eat lunch, do laundry, do homework. Call Mom, call Gary back, call Jon and those guys back. Maybe I should call Mila or Meggie?  I don't know, I just talked to them the other day. Might not be the best timing. Guess I should anyway. Man, I need to stop spending money. I want to add up my receipts and see how much I have spent. This is goin to be a killer Visa bill month. Time's almost up! Yea!   ","n","n","n","n","n"
