"2000_798925.txt","Be able to describe the kinetic theory of matter and explain what kinetic energy is. Distinguish between movement and net movement. Be able to describe the factors that affect the direction and speed of molecular movement and net movement. Define and distinguish between: selectively permeable, plasma membrane, dialysis tubing. Explain how the following transport mechanisms work. For each mechanism, also discuss the factors that affect the rate and direction of transport: simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, dialysis, and solute pumping. Explain how chemical indicators can be used to test for the presence of starch, reducing sugars, and sodium chloride. Distinguish between isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions. Also explain what happens to cells, with and without cell walls, when they are placed in each type of solution. Distinguish between independent and dependent variables and be able to identify both types of variables in an experiment. Procedures: First, obtain the following materials: 2 room temperature agar plates, labeled A and B,1 refrigerated agar plate, labeled C, Potassium permanganate solution, Methylene blue solution, marking pen, ruler, and pasteur pipettes. Turn the agar plate labeled ''A'' upside down and make two small dots on the bottom of the plate with the marker. Each dot should be at least 2cm from the edge of the plate and at least 3cm away from the other dot. Next to one dot write ''potassium permanganate'' and next to the other dot write ''Methylene blue''. Mark plates ''B'' and ''C'' the same way. Remove the lid from agar plate ''A''. Using a micropipette, withdraw 10 microliters of potassium permanganate solution and use it to make a small, neat droplet of dye solution directly above the correspondingly labeled dot. Place a similar dot of potassium permanganate solution on plates ''B'' and ''C''. Use the same procedure to place small, neat drops of Methylene blue dye solution on your plates. Keep plates A and B at room temperature, and place plate C back in the refrigerator. Every 15 minutes, determine the diameter of the dye circles. Record your measurements in a table. Now, label five 200mL beakers 15. Fill the beakers with about 150mL of the solutions listed in the table below: ","n","y","y","n","y"
