"2002_032413.txt","     I am really hungry right now. I think I'll go eat lunch in about twenty minutes or so since that's how long I have to sit here. I hope my classes this year won't be so hard. I want to be somewhere tropical maybe Cozumel or Aruba. The weather here is ok but it's so hot. Like the other day I think I was going to pass out because I had to walk like 2 miles across campus and then I found out I was in the wrong building. Some of the people who work here are real jerks. The girl at the library was no help and she was rude to top it off. She told me to go to the help desk when I asked her how I got an IF account. I dont' miss that many people in Baytown. I do miss my parents and my dog Frida. I wonder how tommorow will go since it's Sept. 11. i hope no one pulls any stupid pranks or anything like that. I really wish I could be with my family but thats no possible since they live 3 hours away and I have classes. My cousins are so cute. I am looking at t picture of them right now. Lauren is a so elegant looking and Suzanne's the quirky one. I feel bad for Nicole becau se she is losing her job. Dynegy was bound to go under once ENgron did. I never kep up with that guy Kenneth Lay, the CEO for ENgron, or I think thats what he was. I miss seeing my dad and visiting him at his work. I wonder if I am depressed. Sometimes it's hard for me to sleep at night, but who knows. I have one, two three four, five six pictures in frrames in my room. My roommate just left for class. SHe is cool, but We have some conflicting religious beliefs. Being a mormon must be hard. I know the are ostracized alot. I justdon't get the spirit child thing about how we were spirit children in heaven with God before we were born. . or the part I read somewhere about how you have to wear holy underwear and things of that nature. TO me,that's just crazy,but I have to respect other people's religions and beliefs because that's what I expect from them in return. I am so hungry. I want to go eat. I wonder if I have gained any weight since I've been here. When I played soccer in highschool I was so much more muscular and toned. Now I have to find time to work out. Where is Sarah? I think is in her room or doing laundry. Her room mate is so nice, but I feel bad for her because of that Nick guy she dated who just broke up with her. SHe is too nice. SHe's to pretty for him anyways. Some of the food inthe cafeteria scares me. I always hear horror stories about people eating food and finding things in what they are eating. Ughhhh. Now I'm not going to be hungry anymore. I don't have anything in here to eat except for fruit. I am sick of getting up at 8 in the morning to go to Spanish. My professor is ok, but he can be too sarcastic at times and I just want to yell. Yeah. so I am debating on whether I should do the Diamond Dolls. Jenny is in it and she said it was fun. Chris would get mad though. I don't know. He may play baseball here next year, or thats what I think now. but I hope he does. My cold is annoying. What time does the mean lady at the front desk work? SHe is gripey. Jessica and her boyfriend fight alot. Kalie shouldn't tell them what to do but Ithink she just feels authoritative because that's how her stepdad seemed when I met him. Where am I going to eat tonight? Is Uncle Phil back in town. That birthday card Kara sent me was really sweet. I'm glad we have become closer than we used to be. I used to think we would never be close because we don't have that many of the same interests. SHe has lost weight. I wish I could lose 10 lbs. I am going to work out at 3. Then I will be back here at 4. take a shower, call Aunt Beth and see when we are going to eat tonight. Mimi and Poppa are coming. that's good since I never see them . How far is Granger from here? There is a really loud annoying girl who lives in my hall. She talks about crude things. I wonder if you can tell how smart I am by reading what I'm writing. I hope I don't sound like a fool. Who reads these things anyways. I like listening to Enrique. where is he? When is lunch over? Gosh I need to stop thinkng about food. That's not good. I don't want to be fat when I get olded. How many students does UT's law school take every year. I wonder if I could get in. I need to send those checks off so they don't expire. I am so wasteful sometimes. I need to get a book rack so my books and folders aren't thrown all over the floor. How fast does the fastest typer in the world type? I think I type like 60 words a minute. maybe I'm off. that was like years ago in BCIS. Tomorrow better be safe for everyone. I am cold. THe ac is on high. . yeas ","y","y","n","n","y"
