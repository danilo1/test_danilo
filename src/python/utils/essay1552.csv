"2002_077680.txt","     I don't know what to write about right now. I guess i'll start by telling you how I feel right now. I've been a little depressed lately. Complicated stuff with my girlfriend. Well she's not really my girlfriend becuase she said we are only   dating   so it isn't as serious as going out. She's in K D Phi so she's been really busy with sorority stuff. I guess I just miss spending time with her. I also thought about joining Lamda because I couldn't hang out with her. Now I realize that would be a bad move becuase I need to concentrate on my classes. I am going to make an   A   in all of my classes. I need this 4. 0 to have a better chance getting into the Business school. My sister believes I can do this and I think that if I try really hard I will do it. Wow it's only been three mins and 50 seconds. This is harder than I thought. Hmm I don't know what else to say and I feel obligated to keep typing the entire twenty minutes. I just popped my knuckles and I know i should stop doing that because it's really bad for me. I'll prob end up having arthritis when I get old. I'll talk about my environment now. I'm in my friends room at Jester West. Room 151. There are four of them in this room. Caleb just said he hates working on Fridays. I would too, if i had a job =P. Enoch is sitting beside me and doing stuff on his computer. He said he needs to work on some website this weekend. Caleb is eating barbeque he got from Jester City Limits. He said the sauce is kind of spicy. They are watching Fox News right now. Now back to MTV and Shikra is on. Damn she's hot =). Marco is on his computer messing with some photoshop stuff. I don't know how to use photoshop. I just play games on my computer. Oh yeah, and sometimes do homework on it =P. wowowow, its only been 8 minutes and 20 seconds. dang time is going by slowly. haha, now they are watching tennis. ok, nevermind they are just flipping through the channels. It smells really bad now, someone farted =X. Marco said it wasn't him but i think it was. Enoch is getting me to write more. Now he's telling his brother that he was put on the second network. For some reason last night his uploads went crazy, which put him over the bandwidth limit. The second network doesn't seem that bad. All the webpages he went to opened quickly and stuff. Marco needs a new computer. He's singing it to some song on mtv right now.   I need a new computer. mine's a piece of trash. whoaahh   haha weirdo right? =P  uhh ohh now everyone is humming/singing to the song!  oOoOo a girl is coming here right now, because it says on her away message that she is stopping by. dang it now its been 12 minutes 30 seconds. lalalalalala I miss Patti =P this sucks. I was pretty sad last night because i started thinking about her again. Well atleast she goes to the same school. My friend Alex goes here, and his girlfriend Jenny goes to . that girl is here now. oh yea jenny goes to UT arlington. Needa smells like girly stuff, she smells good. She said girls fart and go number 2 just like guys. Jenny is going to try to transfer to Austin next year. She's been more depressed than i have because she hates it there. She found jizz on her couch at her apartment and she was like what the hezzy. =\ oh yeah i left my phone in someone's car and haven't gott   its evolution baby!   - marco - weirdo. i haven't gotten my phone back yet. I went ALL day yesterday without my phone. I was a new experience. A bad one. jenny's instant messaging me right now. hmm 16 minutes and 40 seconds. almost done!  haha i guess thats what i'm suppose to be talking about right? what's going through my mind. caleb doesn't know what this is he asked me ahaha here ill start writing lyrics for   marco is stupid    haha he's watching so i had to write that. nevermind the song goes to fast, i cant' type the lyrics. woot! almost done less than 2 minutes left. i played volleyball last night for the first time in a couple years. there were some guys there that were really good, and i had this short girl on my team named isabel  and they spiked it at her really hard and she was like   ahhh   and got out of the way of the ball, it was funny. 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 29 30 haha i'm almost done woohoo. first writing assignment finished in 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 woot!
