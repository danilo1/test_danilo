"1997_577009.txt","  I am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow  of my thoughts its about 1:30 in the morning the day of the first UT football  game that was successfully won by the Horns my roommate is sleeping right now  it seem that he sleeps almost 14 hours a day it makes me mad that for some  reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. All he does every day  is go to class, which I guess I should give him credit for that, and when  class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things  or he lays in bed and watches TV or movies all day he is not that social  either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any  intramurals. He doesn't study whatsoever I guess I am just worried about  him because I care about him I mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. It seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type  and I was the reclusive type and about since the 10th grade the situation has  taken a 180 degree turn I hope they televise the 49er game that they are  playing against the Rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate  thinks that the 49er don't have a prayer I believe that this opportunity will  be a coming out party for JJ Stokes and the emergence of Jim Drunkenmiller the  last rookie quarterback to start for the Niners was Joe Montana hopefully a  good sign I am also kind of disappointed that I am not able to join the  professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings  when I have my CH301 extension course from 6 to7:30 PM but hey looking at the  positive side I have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is  great to be alive I feel like I am on top of the world everything is working  like clockwork I feel like watching Disney movies well it's about 2 o'clock  so I guess that I should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me  tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - :      ","y","n","n","y","n"
