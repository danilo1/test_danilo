"1999_707577.txt","I am writing my first assignment for psychology 301. I am in my room right now. I like my room. I live in Dobie. I live on the 23rd floor. I hate waiting on the elevator. It takes too long. I don't feel like using punctuation or capitalization. I don't have to becasue you told us not to worry about it. I don't even have to worry about spelling either. I'm just typing away. my roommate just passed gas, broke wind, but I do not smell it. yet. My roommate is calling his parents. he left a message. he is going back to houston this weekend for a funeral service for one of his school friends. 2 people died from my school shortly after graduation. it is really sad. I knew one of them. I didnt like him too much because he was annoying, but now I feel bad. he would have left for the navy 2 weeks after that. anyways, my roommate is playing music from his computer, it is really loud, it is an old song, I have no clue what it is. now its playing snoop doggy dogg, it is really old. it is 10:35, I have been typing for 10 minutes now. my suite mates are studying, or attempting to study. we just finished watching MTV music awards. it was really cool. I have never watched so much cable before since my family never ever had cable before. so I watch it all the time. my speaker is right in front of my face. I am trying to type without looking at tke keyboard. I am doing okay, but it is pretty hard. my girl friend os tired. her name is christina. shes looking at my computer screen. she is funny. and very pretty. my side of the room is pretty messy. I need to clean it up. I need to get some book shelves for my books and other items. it is almost friday, I can't wait. today is september 9, 1999. also known as, 9/9/99. people said that bad things are going happen today. but nothing has happened yet, except. one of my suite mates failed his calculus quiz. I just finished my math homework. I am pround of myself. yea! um. anyways. who is going to read this? professor pennebaker? or patrick? oh crap! I forgot to go to SI today. crap crap! I went last week. a lot of people were there. people even sat outside in the hallway. are we going to get a bigger classroom? ethernet is nice. it goes really fast. but not fast enough for $30 a month. what a rip off! my parents already pay a lot for the dorm, and we still have to get over charged for a phone line and ethernet. its not even that fast either. okay, my time is up here. it was fun writing this.
