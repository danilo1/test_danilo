"1999_638622.txt","I don't really know how to start this. I'm not sure what I'm thinking. It's so hot and I'm so tired. I wish I could have watched the baseball game yesterday. People on the Emmy's give the stupidest speeches, I really like Noah Wiley. I wish I knew who a l;ot of the poeple who come up there are. I shouldn't have this on while I'm doing homework. I can't believe it took me so long to figure out Wilma Flinstone today at the picnic. I wish I had met more people and that the cute guy was there. It's 9:20, I need to go to bed early. I hope my alram wakes me up in the morning. I keep correcxting my spelling and I'm not supposed to do that. Those girls always play Dave Matthews, at least it's Dave Matthews. Maybe I should close the door. I think the people in the dorm think I work all the time. I hope the weird guys don't by to see Clare. I wish my room didn't look like this I'm so tired of it. two weeks into school and I'm tired of my room. twenty minutes is too long to do this. my watch ticks so lloud. I wish it would tsop, it's driving me crazy. Why is Clare's computer sneezing. The closest door is open, its bothering me. I should close the closet door and the otehr one. Why do we leave our door open so much. They tell you to lock it when you're in the room. We are going to be killed in our sleep actually we lock it in our sleep and leave it open when we're awake, so I don't think we'll be killed in our sleep. Clare's back. Clare's reading what I write. My concentration is broken. I can't do this, this is os hard. I don't think I'm thinking of anything original are thinking like I usually think because I know I'm supposed to be thinking. I wish frasier had won the emmy. What do I have this song on, I know I have it. this is do hard to do. I cna't think of anything when I'm supposed to be thinking of stuff. What cd, do I have this song on. I really wish that I could look and see what cd I have theat song on but I'm doing this and I still have ten minutes, no maybe 5 finutes left. I started at 9:17. I ahve five minutes to write what I'm thinking but all I'm thinking abbout is what to write, or what to think. Clare's killing her sheep. The one on her computerthat's sneezing. oh, I'm not supposed to do that, explain what I'm thinking. This is so ahrd. Who's that author who writes in stream of consiousness, I hated reading that book. what was that. james joyce. I wish my computer was faster. I really want a new one. buti don't want to ask. Clare says its faulkner. ","y","n","y","y","n"
