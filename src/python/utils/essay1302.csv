"2000_770472.txt","Well, what to write about? I just got done playing football, we won. I am glad that we won because I really hate to lose. In high school my team went 3 and 7, and that just drove me crazy. As our record got worse my teammates stopped trying, and that killed me inside. I don't know what to really write about, I don't really feel much right now. I guess that means that I am happy with myself. School is cool so far. It is a lot different from high school, because you can't really get to know your teachers and let them help you get through all of your stuff. It sucks that Texas lost. I can't believe that they wasted their season already. I just got back from seeing my sister. She is 8 months pregnant with her first baby. It is a little boy and they are going to call it Jason Jr. That is real cool, I really like little babies. I hope that when I have a baby(hopefully not for quite a while) that it is not too fat. That is one of my biggest fears, having fat kids. I guess because I can remember the hell that I put the fat kids through when I was little. I also wish that I could type faster. I have been sitting here for fifteen minutes already and I only have a quarter of a page done. If I was to double space it I guess I would have half a page, but I haven't yet. I wonder if you want it double spaced. I guess I will go ahead and double space it for you. Well that's twenty minutes so I will finish this line and then go take a shower. ","n","n","n","n","n"
