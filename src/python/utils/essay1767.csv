"2002_741268.txt","     I really want to wear my new clothes tomorrow, especially my   pretty pink shirt but it goes really well with my new skirt so I want to   wear them together but i don't want to wear my skirt tomorrow   because it might rain and I don't want to get it all dirty. So may be I   will wear my red shirt tomorrow and the skirt the day after depending   on the weather. Or I could wear the pink shirt tomorrow and the red   shirt on tuesday and the denim one on friday or saturday then I can   wear the pink shirt again on next tuesday and I'll wear the skirt with   it. I don't know what I'll wear wednesday, maybe I'll borrow   something from Hahn. I can't wait until I turn 18 next month then I'll   be able to go clubbin on friday and saturday nights and  I won't have   to hang out with David and Chris' losery friends all the time and go   to there   parties   that really suck. I want to dance and get all freaky   on the dance floor like back home. Then Alan can come visit or I'll   go to san Antonio and we can party. He is such an amazing dancer,   and so sexy, we would have so much fun. Hopefully I will get lots of   money for my birthday and I will be able to buy lots of cute clothes   and look even sexier than I aready do!  I can't wait for my birthday. I   geuss I will celebrate it the week before with my parents when I go   home for the Homecoming game, and maybe I'll go tothe dance with   Ross. Then on my actual bday weekend Brandon and jonny will   come up and I will party with them at some club or something and   maybe they will get a hotel room so I wonthave to sneak them into   my dorm room late at night because that may not work so well.   Then the next week Nikki and Karla and Tina are definatly coming up   and we will have good times. I guess we could say that nikki is   Katis and i'll register Karla ad Tina as my guests or we could just   hav a big slumber party at hanh's apartment. Speaking of slumber   parties, crystal and Jessica want to come visit for my bday weekend   also and I don't quite Know how that will work out with brandon and   jonny coming.
