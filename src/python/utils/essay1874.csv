"2002_953283.txt","     I miss my family. They mean a great deal to me and and love them very much. Without my best friend, Sam, here with me, I wouldn't be here writing this thing. I have never been away from home for more than 10 days and it is something that I know will take some time to get used too. This weekend I will get to see my family and one of my other best friends, Ben, and his family. Sam and I are going to meat them at Lake LBJ Friday afternoon. Wakeboarding, my family and friends, it will be great, I can't wait until Friday. Ut is a lot harder than the junior college I used to go to, its on whole other level and thats why I'm here.  Its time for me to go to the next level and do what I do best, create. I have met a lot of really good people over the last 2 weeks, my friend Sam introduced me to RUF, its a Bible study for college kids, its good me and I like it. Sam also introduced me to Ultimate frisbee, its totally sweet, I'm thinking of playing intermurals, last year the RUF team won the damn thing. I feel more alone right now than I ever have in my life and I think I'm taking it pretty good. I talk to my family everyday and that helps, but when I walk in my door there isn't anybody there who loves me or who asks me how my day was it hurts. Its something that only time can heal. I'm at the age when its time to   leave the nest   so to speak and I've been ready, then questioned myself, then proved my readiness again. My desire to create and express myself grows everyday, as soon as I gain ascess to a darkroom my work will be some of the best I have ever produced to this date. I have never had these intence feallings and I think they will show in my prints. I also have the desire to write a song, my friend Garret, that I met through RUF, and is also one of Sams roomates, writes songs and plays the guitar. I know I can't sing and I know I can't play so writting seems to be a good choice for musical expression. ","y","n","n","y","y"
